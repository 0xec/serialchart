#Describes Configuration file syntax for SerialChart application (.scc files)

= Introduction =

SerialChart configuration is done through a text file. The general format of the file is as follows:
{{{
[section1]
param1 = value
param2 = value
...

[section2]
param1 = value
param2 = value
}}}
= Details =

Each configuration file starts with the `[_setup_]` section, here you can setup global parameters. For example:
{{{
[_setup_]
port=COM3   
baudrate=57600

width=1000
height=201
background_color = white

grid_h_origin = 100
grid_h_step = 10
grid_h_color = #EEE
grid_h_origin_color = #CCC

grid_v_origin = 0
grid_v_step = 10
grid_v_color = #EEE
grid_v_origin_color = transparent
}}}

Below is explanation of the parameters in the `[_setup_]` section:

===port=== 
Specifies the communication port to which the software connects. For ex: COM1,COM2,..

===baudrate=== 
Baudrate in bps (bits per second). Only certain values are currently supported: 110,300,600,1200,2400,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200. 

_Please note that currently no flow control parameters are supported, and parity will default to "none", stop bits defaults to 1, as these are most common values._

==width,height==
width and height of the chart area in pixels

===background_color===
